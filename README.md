要讓使用者可以從 Option 選擇 `time_limit` 與 `turn_buffer`

加上 `Protest Sign` 的 icon


When the player plays the game for 1 hour, a notification will show up to warn the player to end the current game session in 5 turns and get some rest. If the player continues to play after 5 turns, the empire will strat to gain unhappiness.

The citizens believe that a good leader should make important decision at his or he best condition. They will not be happy to see a leader working all day without getting any rest.
