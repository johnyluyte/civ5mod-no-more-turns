[h1] What does this Mod do [/h1]

[b]This Mod restricts your single Civilization V gaming session time. [/b]

So you won't be playing Civ5 for 12 hours straight anymore, which is bad for your health.

Your mother cares about you, and I do, too.

(Jokes aside you should really stand up and do some stretches often. Little moves make big difference to your health.)

[h1] How? [/h1]

When the player plays the game for 1 hour, a notification will show up to warn the player to end the current gaming session in 5 turns. If the player continues to play after 5 turns, the empire will start to increase unhappiness.

Please see the images above for further information.

[h1] Options [/h1]

The default "time limit" is 1 hour, and the default "buffered turn" is 5 turns. You can change these values by editing the variables.

Please see the images above for further information.

[h1] Notes [/h1]
