## Todo

- Before publishing, remeber to disable debug mode.
- The player should be able to tweak two options in the OptionsMenu.
  - A. (Slider) How many minutes is allowed in a single game session. (default is 60)
  - B. (Slider) After A. is reached, how many turns are left before the citizens start to protest. (default is 5)
- Add icon for `Protest Sign`. (Currently we are using the [Ikanda](http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/Ikanda_(Civ5)) icon.)
- Are there better ways to implement unhappiness modifier?
- Change descriptions to not make false sense.
