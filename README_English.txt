[h1] What does this Mod do [/h1]

[b]This Mod restricts your single Civilization V gaming session time. [/b]

So you won't be playing Civ5 for 12 hours straight anymore, which is bad for your health.


[h1] How? [/h1]

When the player plays the game for 1 hour, a notification will show up to warn the player to end the current gaming session in 5 turns. If the player continues to play after 5 turns, the empire will start to increase unhappiness.

Please see the images above for further information.
